You are given a tree consisting of n nodes, and m paths in the tree.

Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node.

Input

The first input line contains integers n and m: the number of nodes and paths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Finally, there are m lines describing the paths. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is a path between nodes a and b.

Output

Print n integers: for each node 1,2,…,n, the number of paths containing that node.

Constraints
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
1≤a,b≤n
