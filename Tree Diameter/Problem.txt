You are given a tree consisting of n nodes.

The diameter of a tree is the maximum distance between two nodes. Your task is to determine the diameter of the tree.

Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output

Print one integer: the diameter of the tree.

Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅105
1≤a,b≤n
Example

Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
3

Explanation: The diameter corresponds to the path 2→1→3→5.
