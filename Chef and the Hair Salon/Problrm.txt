Chef recently realized that he needs a haircut, and went to his favorite hair salon. At the salon, he found N customers 
waiting for their haircuts. From his past experience, Chef knows that the salon takes M minutes per customer. Only one
 person can get their haircut at a time.

For how many minutes will Chef have to wait before he can get his haircut?
