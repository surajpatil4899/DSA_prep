Sometimes mysteries happen. Chef found a directed graph with N vertices and M edges in his kitchen!

The evening was boring and chef has nothing else to do, so to entertain himself, Chef thought about a question
"What is the minimum number of edges he needs to reverse in order to have at least one path from vertex 1 to vertex 
where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.
