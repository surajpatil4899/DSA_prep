You are given a tree consisting of n nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the sum of the distances from the node to all other nodes.

Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output

Print n integers: for each node 1,2,…,n, the sum of the distances.

Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅105
1≤a,b≤n
Example

Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
6 9 5 8 8
