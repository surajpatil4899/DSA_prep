You are given an integer  such that the XOR of two integers  is . In short  (âŠ• denotes the bitwise the XOR operation).

Out of all possible pairs of  and , you must find two integers such that their product is maximum. 

Let us define  as the length of  in its binary representation. Then,  and .

Input format 

A single integer representing  ()

Output format 

Print the maximum product you can achieve under the given conditions.

Sample Input
13
Sample Output
70
Time Limit: 1
Memory Limit: 256
Source Limit:
Explanation
The binary representation of 13 is "1101".

We can use A=10 ("1010" in binary) and B=7 ("0111" in binary). This gives us the product 70. No other valid pair (A,B) can give us a larger product.
