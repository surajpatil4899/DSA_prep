Given an array of n integers, your task is to process q queries of the following types:
increase each value in range [a,b] by u
what is the value at position k?
Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of values and queries.

The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the array values.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has three integers: either "1 a b u" or "2 k".

Output

Print the result of each query of type 2.

Constraints
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
1≤xi,u≤109
1≤k≤n
1≤a≤b≤n
