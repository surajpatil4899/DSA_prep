Problem Statement
There are N items, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), Item i has a weight of w 
i
​
  and a value of v 
i
​
 .

Taro has decided to choose some of the N items and carry them home in a knapsack. The capacity of the knapsack is W, which
 means that the sum of the weights of items taken must be at most W.

Find the maximum possible sum of the values of items that Taro takes home.

Sample Input 1 
Copy
3 8
3 30
4 50
5 60
Sample Output 1 
Copy
90
Items 1 and 3 should be taken. Then, the sum of the weights is 3+5=8, and the sum of the values is 30+60=90.

Sample Input 2 
Copy
5 5
1 1000000000
1 1000000000
1 1000000000
1 1000000000
1 1000000000
Sample Output 2 
Copy
5000000000
The answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.

Sample Input 3 
Copy
6 15
6 5
5 6
6 4
6 6
3 5
7 2
Sample Output 3 
Copy
17
Items 2,4 and 5 should be taken. Then, the sum of the weights is 5+6+3=14, and the sum of the values is 6+6+5=17.
