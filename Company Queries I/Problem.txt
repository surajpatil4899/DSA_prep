A company has n employees, who form a tree hierarchy where each employee has a boss, except for the general director.

Your task is to process q queries of the form: who is employee x's boss k levels higher up in the hierarchy?

Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of employees and queries. The employees are numbered 1,2,…,n, and employee 1 is the general director.

The next line has n−1 integers e2,e3,…,en: for each employee 2,3,…,n their boss.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers x and k: who is employee x's boss k levels higher up?

Output

Print the answer for each query. If such a boss does not exist, print −1.

Constraints
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
1≤ei≤i−1
1≤x≤n
1≤k≤n
