Your task is to build a tower whose width is 2 and height is n. You have an unlimited supply of blocks whose width and height are integers.

For example, here are some possible solutions for n=6:

Given n, how many different towers can you build? Mirrored and rotated towers are counted separately if they look different.

Input

The first input line contains an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines, and each line contains an integer n: the height of the tower.

Output

For each test, print the number of towers modulo 109+7.

Constraints
1≤t≤100
1≤n≤106
